Plugin for [Open CAD Studio](https://github.com/HakanSeven12/OpenCADStudio) for infrastructure and civil engineering (infra en civiele techniek), in the Netherlands and worldwide.

- **GIS workbench**, modelled on the FreeCAD GIS(2BIM) workbench. Set the project location and coordinate system, then pull aerial photos, WMS/WFS layers and OpenStreetMap straight into the DWG.
- **Dutch base data conform NLCS**, like InfraCAD Map: BGT, cadastral map and KLIC deliveries on NLCS layers, with object data and a finished drawing sheet.
- **AHN heights**: spot heights, contour lines and length profiles from AHN4, and the AHN5 point cloud attached in 3D.
- **Civil design (second ribbon tab "Civiel")**, Civil 3D-like and after Hakan Seven's FreeCAD Road workbench. It covers:
  - survey points and LandXML;
  - terrain (TIN, contours, height analysis);
  - alignments with stationing;
  - length, design and cross sections;
  - corridors with daylight and earthwork.
- **3D city and landscape model**: the AHN terrain coloured by the aerial photo, 3D BAG buildings (LoD 1.2–2.2) and the whole BGT in 3D.
- **Scriptable and agent-ready**: every command takes arguments and reports back as JSON. An MCP server ([`mcp/`](mcp/README.md)) lets an AI agent build whole models.

## In Open CAD Studio

![Open CAD Studio with the Open Infra ribbon tab and the example drawing](docs/images/open-cad-studio-open-infra.png)

The ribbon tab **"Open Infra — GIS"**:

| Group | Button | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Webservices | **Geo-locatie** | Set the project location. Click it on the map, or search an address, street, place, parcel, `lat, lon` or RD `x y`. Suggestions appear while you type (PDOK); Enter also searches worldwide (Nominatim). Each hit shows its kind, name and place; use the arrow keys and Enter to pick. Choose the coordinate system, draw or type the bounding box, and choose absolute or relative coordinates. Optionally place a base-point marker and import an aerial photo. The location is stored in the drawing (NOD XRecord `OPENINFRA/SITE`). |
| | **WMS / TMS** | Choose a server and browse its layers. **Test** shows a preview on the map; **OK en importeren** places IMAGE underlays behind the drawing. |
| | **WFS** | Choose a server and feature type. **Test** draws the objects on the map. Then set the label attribute, colour and clipping. |
| | **OpenStreetMap** | Worldwide themes: buildings, roads, rail, water, civil structures, land use, cables and pipelines, fences, house numbers. |
| | **PDOK (NL)** | Several Dutch base registers in one go: aerial photo, cadastral map, AHN, BAG, parcels, NWB road sections and hectometre markers, ProRail tracks and kilometre markers, waterways. |
| Snel importeren | **Kaartbeeld ▾ / Vectordata ▾** | One click, no window, using the saved location. |
| Basisdata NL (NLCS) | **BGT · BRK · KLIC** | The NLCS page of the workbench (see below). |
| | **BGT** · **Kadaster** | One click: the current BGT, or cadastral boundaries and parcel numbers, on NLCS layers. |
| | **KLIC** | Open a KLIC delivery: the Kadaster zip or `GI_gebiedsinformatielevering_*.xml`. It is shown on the map, then drawn. |
| | **Tekenblad** | NLCS drawing sheet around the import area: frame, title block, legend of the layers used, north arrow, scale bar and RD coordinate crosses. |
| Hoogte (AHN) | **AHN** | The AHN page of the workbench: options, and **Test** to show contour lines on the map. |
| | **Hoogtepunten** · **Hoogtelijnen** | Spot heights in a grid, and contour lines (minor/major, labelled) from AHN4, at their true elevation. |
| | **Profiel** | Length profile along a selected polyline or picked points: ground (DTM) and optionally surface (DSM), height grid, profile band with distances and heights, and section line A–A' in plan. |
| | **Puntenwolk** | The AHN5 (or AHN4) point cloud of the import area, coloured by class, height or RGB. It is written as `.rcs` next to the drawing and attached; it shows in a 3D visual style. |
| Hulpmiddelen | **Gebied** · **Punt info** · **Coördinaten** · **Servers** | Pick the import area in the drawing, read a point's coordinates, convert coordinates, and manage presets and your own WMS/WFS/XYZ servers. |

## The Civiel tab (Civil 3D-like)

A second plugin, `openaec.open-infra-civiel`, adds the ribbon tab **"Open Infra — Civiel"**. It shares the engine and the project location with the GIS tab. Everything goes on NLCS layers.

| Group | Tools | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| Punten | **Punten importeren** · Punt plaatsen · Punten exporteren · LandXML | Survey points from PNEZD/PENZD/CSV files: separator, decimal comma and north/east order are detected. Points go on `OG-HOOGTEPUNT` with number, height and code. Clicked points get their ground height from the TIN or AHN. LandXML 1.x brings in points, surfaces and alignments (lines, curves, clothoid spirals). |
| Oppervlak | **TIN maken** · Hoogtelijnen · Hoogteanalyse · Grondverzet | A TIN (Delaunay, longest-edge filter) from points, 3D lines, contour lines or AHN, as 3D faces on `OG-TRIANGULATIE`: status **B** for existing ground, **N** for a design. Then: exact contours on the TIN; elevation bands with a legend; cut and fill between design (N) and existing (B), or against a level. |
| As | **As maken** · As verschuiven · Station / offset | An axis from a polyline or from points of intersection with curve radii (Civil 3D *by layout*). It gets stationing `0+100` on `AM-KILOMETRERING`, tangent points BB/EB/HP on `AM-TANGENTPUNT` and radius labels. Then: offset lines; station and offset of any point. |
| Profielen | **Lengteprofiel** · Ontwerpprofiel · Dwarsprofielen | Length profile over the TIN or AHN, with stationing, heights and an alignment band. The design profile comes from PVIs or a line drawn in the profile: parabolic vertical curves (crest and sag, with L and R), and grade labels. Cross sections along the axis in a grid of views. |
| Corridor | **Corridor** | An assembly swept along the axis and its design profile (or a level). Assemblies: *weg*, *fietspad*, *snelweg*, *dijk*; lane and shoulder widths, cross slopes, fill/cut slopes, crest and superelevation in curves (with runoff) are all adjustable. The corridor builds: daylight to the ground; a design TIN (status N); 3D feature lines (asphalt edge, shoulder, toe and crest of slope); cut and fill per section with average-end-area volumes and a mass balance (CSV); optional section views with the design. |
| 3D-model | **3D BAG** · Terrein + luchtfoto · BGT naar 3D | See below. |

The window page **Civiel — instellingen** holds all settings, and they also apply to the ribbon buttons. Checked on a real road near Dordrecht: the corridor's average-end-area volumes and the independent TIN-to-TIN grid volume agree within 2 %.

## 3D city and landscape model

| | |
|---|---|
| **Terrein + luchtfoto** (`CIV_FOTOTERREIN`) | The AHN ground of the project area as a 3D surface in cells of 1–5 m. Each cell takes the colour of the PDOK aerial photo (8 cm), quantised to a palette, with one mesh per colour. Gaps (water, under buildings) are filled from their lowest neighbour. |
| **3D BAG** (`CIV_BAG3D`) | Every building from the [3D BAG](https://3dbag.nl) (TU Delft, CC BY 4.0) in LoD 1.2, 1.3 or 2.2: one roof mesh and one wall mesh per building, with BAG id, year of construction and height as object data. |
| **BGT naar 3D** (`CIV_BGT3D`) | The whole BGT of the project area in 3D, on its NLCS layers. Areas are draped on the ground: the edges every 3 m, a grid inside, and holes respected. Buildings and walls are extruded to the AHN surface, water lies at its level, bridges at deck height, lines are draped, and posts and trees become 3D symbols. Colours are natural by default (asphalt, paving, grass, water…); `KLEUR=nlcs` uses the layer colours. |

![Dordrecht city centre in 3D: AHN terrain with the aerial photo, the BGT in 3D and 3D BAG LoD 2.2, with a ring road and a dike as corridors](docs/images/dordrecht-3d-model.png)

|---|---|
| ![Grote Kerk](docs/images/dordrecht-3d-grote-kerk.png) | ![Corridor](docs/images/dordrecht-corridor.png) |

Dordrecht city centre (1.2 × 1.0 km), built by an agent through the MCP server (`tests/e2e/mcp_model.py`, 20 steps in about 110 s):
- 299,000 photo-coloured terrain cells;
- 18,560 BGT objects (about 480,000 triangles);
- 2,864 buildings in LoD 2.2 (204,000 triangles);
- a 1.2 km ring road and a 0.9 km dike as corridors, with 178 cross sections. Their earthwork from the sections and from the design TIN against the existing ground agree within 1 %.

**Large drawings:**
- Open CAD Studio sends a plugin at most 64 MB per message, and shares a document view of 16 MB by default.
- Open Infra sends entities in batches under that limit and draws 3D objects as light MESH entities.
- It keeps an object index in the drawing (`OPENINFRA/INDEX`: terrains, axes, profiles, corridors, survey points), so the civil commands fetch what they need by handle at any drawing size.
- Whole-drawing tools (NLCS check, quantities) need the shared view. For drawings over 16 MB, start Open CAD Studio with `OCS_V4_SNAPSHOT_SEGMENT_SIZE=268435456` (256 MB; larger values exceed the 1 GiB the plugin side maps).

## Scripting, API and MCP server

Every `CIV_` command and the GIS data commands take arguments:
- `KEY=value`;
- points `x,y` in project coordinates;
- lists separated by `;`.

With `ID=<name>` the outcome is written to `<config>/OpenCADStudio/open-infra/api/<name>.json`, as `{ok, message, data}` with handles, lengths, volumes and so on. This makes Open Infra drivable from scripts and from Open CAD Studio's REST/automation API. `CIV_HELP` and `GIS_HELP` list the arguments.

```
GIS_SITE RD 104900 425350 1200 1000 Dordrecht binnenstad ID=s1
CIV_AS PI=104350,424900;104800,424950;105300,424900 R=200 NAAM=Rondweg ID=a1     → data.as = handle
CIV_ONTWERPPROFIEL AS=<handle> PVI=0:1.5;400:3.0;800:2.0 BOOG=120
CIV_CORRIDOR AS=<handle> SJABLOON=weg RIJSTROOK=3.5 TALUD=3 DWARSPROFIELEN=ja ID=c1
```

The [MCP server](mcp/README.md) (`mcp/open_infra_mcp.py`, Python standard library only) offers about 30 tools on top of this, from `oi_site` to `civ_corridor`, `civ_bag3d` and `oi_capture`. It finds every Open CAD Studio window by itself.

## The workbench window

Every page follows the FreeCAD GIS dialogs:

1. A **map** at the top shows the project location and the bounding box.
2. Grouped settings follow.
3. A fixed action bar holds **OK en importeren**, **Test** and **Annuleren**.

You choose the map background in a **Leaflet-style layer switcher** at the top right. Click the map to set the location; Shift+drag draws the bounding box.

## Dutch base data conform NLCS

The NLCS tables and the official NLCS-BGT 5.0 mapping are built in from [`assets/nlcs`](assets/nlcs): objects, colours, linetypes, statuses, disciplines and main groups. The source is DigiGO / Stichting NLCS, under CC BY 4.0. `tools/nlcs_tables.py` regenerates them from a new NLCS publication.

- **Layers:** every object goes on its NLCS layer `STATUS-DISCIPLINE-HOOFDGROEP-OBJECT-ELEMENT`, e.g. `B-XX-VH-GESLOTENVERHARDING_ASFALT-G` or `B-OI-KL-GAS_LD-G`.
  - The layer gets the NLCS colour, lineweight and linetype for the chosen drawing status (B/N/T/V).
  - Linetypes are defined in paper millimetres, and entities get the linetype scale of the plot scale.
  - Elements: G for lines and areas, S for points, T for texts.
- **BGT:** current objects from the PDOK OGC API (`eind_registratie IS NULL`). Each object is mapped to the most specific NLCS-BGT rule, using function, physical appearance and plus attributes. Street names and house numbers are placed at their BGT rotation.
- **Cadastral map (BRK):** parcel boundaries on `KG-GRENS_PERCEEL`, and parcel numbers at their BRK rotation.
- **KLIC:**
  - IMKL 2.0 deliveries are read with OpenAEC's [`klic2geo`](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/crates-warehouse).
  - Each theme goes on its KL or RI object.
  - Cables and pipes get labels such as `G-LD Stedin 160 mm PVC`, with duplicates on parallel cables left out.
  - IMKL theme colours can be used instead of the NLCS colours.
- **Object data:** each entity carries its source attributes as XDATA `OPENINFRA`, for example BGT `lokaal_id`, function and material, or the KLIC operator, diameter and material.
- **Drawing sheet:**
  - The sheet format is chosen automatically (A3–A0 landscape).
  - The title block lists the data sources of the imports.
  - The legend shows the NLCS layers used, grouped by main group.
  - Sheet texts follow the NLCS text classes (T1.8, T2.5, …).

## AHN heights, profiles and point clouds

- **Heights:** AHN4 from the PDOK WCS: DTM (ground level) and DSM (surface), 0.5 m float grids in m NAP. Larger areas are fetched in tiles or at a coarser cell size.
- **Spot heights** go on `OG-HOOGTEPUNT`, with labels such as `+2,43`. **Contour lines** go on `OG-HOOGTELIJN_MINOR/MAJOR` (marching squares on a lightly smoothed grid). Both sit at their real height (Z).
- **Length profile (`GIS_PROFIEL`):**
  - Select a polyline or line, or pick points and press Enter. Then pick the lower-left corner of the profile.
  - The profile draws the ground line on `GW-MAAIVELD`, optionally the surface line, and a height grid with NAP labels.
  - The profile band (`AL-PROFIELBALK`) lists distances and heights. The NAP line is drawn when it is in range, and the section line A–A' in plan.
  - The profile breaks where AHN has no ground level (buildings, water).
- **Point cloud (`GIS_PUNTENWOLK`):**
  - AHN5 or AHN4 is read as COPC (Cloud Optimized Point Cloud) from Het Waterschapshuis' 1 km tiles. Only the octree nodes in the import area are downloaded, at the chosen point spacing.
  - The cloud is coloured by class (ground, buildings, water, structures, other), by height or by RGB.
  - It is saved as `.rcs` next to the drawing and attached with POINTCLOUDATTACH.
  - Example: 300 × 250 m at 0.25 m spacing is about 1.4 million points and a 29 MB file.
- **Punt info** also reports the AHN ground and surface height of the picked point.

Length profile across the Grotekerksplein: the ground line breaks at the harbour water and the buildings.

## Coordinate systems and units

- **Built in:**
  - RD New (EPSG:28992)
  - ETRS89 / UTM 31–33N
  - Belgian Lambert 72 and 2008
  - British National Grid
  - CH1903+ / LV95
  - Lambert-93
  - WGS 84 and Web Mercator
- **Automatic UTM** anywhere in the world.
- **Any other EPSG code** is fetched once from epsg.io and stored with the drawing.
- The address search proposes the national grid for the country it finds.
- **RD accuracy:** RD uses the 7-parameter transformation, about 0.2 m from RDNAPTRANS. That is fine for underlays and context. For survey work, use data that is already in RD; PDOK, BGT, BRK and KLIC all supply it that way.
- **Units:** `INSUNITS` sets the drawing units: metres (default for civil drawings), mm or cm.
  - **Absolute:** CRS coordinates go straight into the drawing, as is usual in Dutch infra work.
  - **Relative:** the base point becomes 0,0.
- **Map images** are saved next to the drawing in `<name>_GIS/`.

## Architecture

```
src/gis/          host-free engine: crs (proj4rs), site, servers, caps (WMS/WFS GetCapabilities),
                  geocode, raster (GetMap/XYZ + reprojection), wfs, osm (Overpass), vector (GeoJSON + clipping),
                  ogcapi (OGC API Features), bgt (PDOK BGT), klic (IMKL via klic2geo),
                  ahn (WCS height grids, contours, profiles), pointcloud (COPC over HTTP, .rcs writer)
src/nlcs.rs       NLCS 5.02 tables, layer names and styles, BGT/KLIC → NLCS mapping
src/basisdata.rs  BGT, cadastre and KLIC drawn conform NLCS, with object data
src/tekenblad.rs  NLCS drawing sheet: frame, title block, legend, north arrow, scale bar
src/hoogte.rs     AHN spot heights, contour lines, length profiles and point clouds in the drawing
src/emit.rs       engine output → DWG entities (LWPOLYLINE, TEXT, CIRCLE, IMAGE)
src/bridge.rs     host requests from worker/window threads, NLCS layers and linetypes, site in the DWG
src/import.rs     import flows shared by the window and the ribbon quick buttons
src/ui/           workbench window (egui), runs in the plugin process beside the CAD window
src/lib.rs        manifest, ribbon, commands (GIS_*), click interaction (Gebied, Punt info)
src/civiel/       civil engine: landmeten (points), terrein (TIN, contours, analysis, earthwork),
                  as_profiel (alignments, profiles, sections), corridor, landxml, model3d (3D BAG,
                  photo terrain, BGT in 3D), api (arguments, JSON results)
src/gis/bag3d.rs  3D BAG client (CityJSON 2.0), rasterbestand.rs (GeoTIFF, ASC, world files, LAS/LAZ)
civiel/           the Civiel plugin: its ribbon tab and CIV_ commands, on the shared engine
mcp/              MCP server for AI agents
```

The repository is a Cargo workspace with two plugins. The GIS plugin is the root crate, with its entry points behind the default feature `plugin`. The Civiel plugin links the same crate without that feature. Build them with separate `cargo build -p …` runs; `scripts/install.sh` does both.

Open CAD Studio runs plugins out-of-process and has no dialog API for plugins, so the plugin opens its own window. Network work runs on worker threads, so the CAD window stays responsive and the plugin call timeout is never reached.

## Installing

Use Open CAD Studio's **Plugin Manager** (`PLUGINS`): choose *Add a repository*, enter `OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-Infra` and install the [latest release](https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/Open-Infra/releases/latest).

Or install by hand:
1. Download `openaec.open-infra-<platform>` and `plugin.toml` from the release.
2. Put them in `<config>/OpenCADStudio/plugins/openaec.open-infra/`.
3. Restart Open CAD Studio.

Release numbers follow Open CAD Studio's calendar numbering. The current code is built for **Open CAD Studio v2026.43** (plugin API 13, opencadcodec `24b037a`, rustc 1.99.1); release 2026.44.2 was for v2026.42. The host only loads a plugin built against its own opencadcodec revision and rustc, so update the plugin together with Open CAD Studio.

## Building

```bash
./scripts/install.sh      # build both plugins and install them into ~/.config/OpenCADStudio/plugins/
cargo test --lib -p open-infra   # engine tests (CRS, clipping, NLCS, TIN, alignments, corridor, 3D BAG, …)
cargo test --test locaties                          # location test set, offline
cargo test --test locaties -- --ignored --nocapture # fetch real data at 16 locations, report in target/locatietest
python3 tests/e2e/ocs_e2e.py                        # end-to-end in Open CAD Studio: import, edit, save, reopen
```

The test set ([`tests/`](tests/README.md)) covers 16 locations: Dutch cities, a polder, the Vaalserberg, the Wadden, and cities across the border and worldwide. It also covers 30 places around the Dutch border, real BGT attributes and a KLIC delivery. It found and fixed several problems:
- the coordinate system for Antwerp and Aachen;
- search results in the wrong town;
- units of mm drawings;
- AHN5 gaps;
- one IMKL colour.

It also lists the host issues still open in Open CAD Studio.

`Cargo.toml` and `civiel/Cargo.toml` pin `ocs_plugin_api` to the Open CAD Studio v2026.43 release. For a newer Open CAD Studio, move the `rev` to the commit of that release, and update the rustc version in `.github/workflows/release.yml` to match.

For development against a local Open CAD Studio checkout, add a `.cargo/config.toml` (not committed):

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/HakanSeven12/OpenCADStudio"]
ocs_plugin_api = { path = "../OpenCADStudio/crates/ocs_plugin_api" }
```

## Platforms
